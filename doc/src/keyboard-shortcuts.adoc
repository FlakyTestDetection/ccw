== Edit modes

=== Conventions

- `(foo |bar)` represents the text `(foo bar)` with the cursor before the `b`
- `(foo |bar|)` represents the text `(foo bar)` with the text `bar` selected

=== Switching between Strict and non-Strict modes

- kbd:[Alt + D]: switch between modes
- kbd:[Esc]: force the next keystroke to be passed as is to the editor buffer, without `Counterclockwise` interfering. After the keystroke. This can help in situations where you don't understand why or don't want Counterclockwise to do some unhelpful behaviour.

=== Default Structural Editing mode

The commands available in the default mode do not interfere with the usage of the editor: the editor will still work as a user used to a straight text editor would assume.

==== Auto-indentation
The editor automatically indents a new line to the right column.

|===

==== Expand Selection Left
Expand selection to the left sibling (or if no sibling form on the left, to the enclosing form).

[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Win/Linux
|OS X
|Examples (repeated invocations)

|kbd:[Shift + Alt + Right]
|kbd:[Shift + Cmd + Right]
