== Editor general shortcuts

=== Go to symbol definition
kbd:[F3] will jump to the definition of the symbol where the cursor was. +
This is a dynamic feature, it requires an active REPL.

=== Open Code Assistant / Code Completion
By default, code assistant pops up automatically when you are typing. +
It is however possible to deactivate it via a preference (menu:Clojure[Editor > Auto Activate code Completion]). In this case, you can use the following keyboard shortcut to invoke code assistant:

== Editor modes

=== Conventions

- `(foo |bar)` represents the text `(foo bar)` with the cursor before the `b`
- `(foo |bar|)` represents the text `(foo bar)` with the text `bar` selected

=== Switching between Strict and non-Strict modes

- kbd:[Alt + D]: switch between modes
- kbd:[Esc]: force the next keystroke to be passed as is to the editor buffer, without `Counterclockwise` interfering. After the keystroke. This can help in situations where you don't understand why or don't want Counterclockwise to do some unhelpful behaviour.

=== Default Structural Editing mode

The commands available in the default mode do not interfere with the usage of the editor: the editor will still work as a user used to a straight text editor would assume.

==== Auto-indentation
kbd:[Enter]: The editor automatically indents a new line to the right column.

==== Expand Selection Up
Expands selection to the enclosing form.

=== Strict Structural Editing Mode (paredit-style)
In addition to the features of the Default Structural Editing mode, this mode does its best to prevent you from breaking the structure of your code.

Note: You'll only feel "at home" in this mode if you know the following commands

==== Reindent line
Reindent the line properly

[cols="1", options="header"]
|===
|Win/Linux/OS X

|kbd:[Tab]
|===

==== Wrap
Wrap the selection (or absence of selection) with parens / square brackets / curly brackets / double quotes.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Win/Linux/OS X
|Examples (repeated invocations)

|kbd:[(]
|`\|foo\|` => kbd:[(] => `(\|foo)`

|kbd:[{]
|`\|foo\|` => kbd:[{] => `{\|foo}`

|kbd:[[]
|`\|foo\|` => kbd:[[] => `[\|foo]`

|kbd:["]
|`\|foo\|` => kbd:["] => `"\|foo"`
|===

==== Jump next
Move the cursor after the nearest paren / square bracket / curly bracket.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Win/Linux/OS X
|Examples (repeated invocations)

|kbd:[)]
|`(foo ([bar b\|az]))` => `(foo ([bar baz])\|)`

|kbd:[}]
| `{:a [:b (inc \|c)] :e :f}`=> `{:a [:b (inc c)] :e :f}\|`

|kbd:[\]]
| `(let [a (inc \|b) c d] blah)` => `(let [a (inc b) c d]\| blah)`
|===

==== Create empty String literal
Inside code without selection.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Win/Linux/OS X
|Examples (repeated invocations)

|kbd:["]
|`foo \|bar` => `foo "\|" bar`
|===

==== String literal auto-escape
When already inside a String literal, typing kbd:["] automatically escapes it with a backslash.

[cols="1", options="header"]
|===
|Example

|`foo "bar \|baz"` =>    kbd:[\"] => `foo "bar \"\|baz"`
|===

Note that if the cursor is at the end of the String literal, just before the closing double quote, typing kbd:["] will make the cursor jump outside the String literal. +
You have thus to manually escape it in at this special cursor position.

==== Delete behaviour
kbd:[Delete] suppresses chars but jumps over opening and closing parens/square brackets/curly brackets if they are non-empty.+
will suppress the whole parens/brackets at once if empty and (currently) right before the closing part.

[cols="1", options="header"]
|===
|Example (repeated invocations)

|`foo\| (bar) baz` => `foo\|(bar) baz` => `foo(\|bar) baz` => `foo(\|ar) baz` => `foo(\|r) baz` => `foo(\|) baz` => `foo\| baz`
|===

==== Baskpace behaviour
kbd:[Backspace] suppresses chars but jumps over closing and opening parens/square brackets/curly brackets if they are non-empty.+
Will suppress the whole parens/brackets at once if empty and (currently) right after the opening part.

[cols="1", options="header"]
|===
|Example (repeated invocations)

|`foo (bar)\| baz` => `foo (bar\|) baz` => `foo (ba\|) baz` => `foo (b\|) baz` => `foo (\|) baz` => `foo \| baz`
|===


=== Interaction with the REPL

REPL stands for "Read Eval Print Loop" an is the clojure/lisp equivalent of so called "interactive shells" of dynamic languages.

==== Launch new REPL

|OS X

|kbd:[Shift + Alt + X + C]

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
|Win/Linux
|OS X

|kbd:[Shift + Alt + D + C]
|kbd:[Shift + Alt + D + C]
|===

==== Evaluate content
Works from any editor or from the REPL, as long as there is an already open REPL.

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
|Win/Linux
|OS X

|kbd:[Ctrl + Enter]
|kbd:[Cmd + Enter]
|===

==== Macro Expand macro call
Works from any editor or from the REPL, as long as there is an already open REPL.

`macroexpand-1`-like:

[cols="1,1", options="header"]

|kbd:[Ctrl + hover over selection]
|===

`macroexpand-all`-like:

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
|Win/Linux/OS X

|kbd:[Ctrl+Shift + hover over selection]
|===

==== Load editor content in active REPL
Loads the editors' content into the active REPL, starting a REPL if no active REPL found.

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
|Win/Linux
|OS X

|kbd:[Ctrl + Alt + S]
|kbd:[Cmd + Alt + S]
|===

==== Switch to Editor namespace
Switches the current namespace of the active REPL to that of the current editor.

== Leiningen launcher Shortcuts

=== Leiningen command line
For most Leiningen projects, using the Eclipse default Clojure launcher will do what you expect, e.g. launching a new VM with an headless nREPL server, and automatically connect a `REPL View` to it.

Nevertheless, should you need to invoke arbitrary Leiningen commands, just type kbd:[Alt + L + L].

=== Reset the Project Classpath computed by Eclipse
kbd:[Alt + L + R] resets the project classpath, using Leiningen to compute the classpath.

=== Update the Project Dependencies
kbd:[Alt + L + U] updates the project dependencies in the classpath, using Leiningen.
